# Reviews-Classification-Website #

**Introduction**

This project aims to classify online reviews as positive, negative, or neutral using sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to determine the sentiment expressed in textual data. This project will leverage various NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate sentiment classification.


**Objectives**
**
Data Collection:** Gather a dataset of online reviews.
**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data.
**Feature Extraction:** Convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
**Model Training**: Train machine learning models to classify the sentiment of reviews.
**Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
**Deployment: **Implement the model in a user-friendly application.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.x
Libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended for development)

Setup

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-reviews-classification.git
cd online-reviews-classification

**Install dependencies:**


pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset: Place the dataset in the data/raw/ directory.

Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing step involves cleaning and preparing the text data for feature extraction. This includes:

Removing HTML tags, special characters, and punctuation
Converting text to lowercase
Tokenization
Removing stopwords
Lemmatization or stemming

**Example usage:**

python
Copy code
from src.data_preprocessing import preprocess_text

raw_text = "I love this product! It's amazing. <br>Highly recommend it."
clean_text = preprocess_text(raw_text)
print(clean_text)
Feature Extraction
Convert the cleaned text data into numerical features using techniques such as:

Bag of Words (BoW)
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
Example usage:

python
Copy code
from src.feature_extraction import extract_features

features = extract_features([clean_text], method='tfidf')
print(features)
Model Training
Train machine learning models using the extracted features. Possible algorithms include:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Neural Networks
Example usage:

python
Copy code
from src.model_training import train_model

model, vectorizer = train_model(features, labels, model_type='logistic_regression')
Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Example usage:

python
Copy code
from src.evaluation import evaluate_model

evaluation_metrics = evaluate_model(model, vectorizer, test_features, test_labels)
print(evaluation_metrics)
Deployment
Deploy the trained model to a user-friendly application, such as a web app or API, allowing users to input reviews and get sentiment predictions.

**Example usage:**

python
Copy code
from src.deployment import predict_sentiment

review = "This product exceeded my expectations!"
prediction = predict_sentiment(model, vectorizer, review)
print(f'Sentiment: {prediction}')
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building an online review classification system using sentiment analysis. By following the steps outlined above, you can collect data, preprocess it, extract features, train models, evaluate their performance, and deploy a sentiment analysis application.
