**Burglar Detection Using Canvas#**
**
Introduction**

This project involves developing a burglar detection system using the HTML5 Canvas element. The system leverages motion detection techniques to identify potential intrusions in real-time by analyzing video streams from a camera. The project showcases how to use Canvas for image processing and detection tasks, creating an interactive and responsive web-based security solution.

**Objectives**

**Video Capture:** Stream video from a camera using HTML5 and JavaScript.
**Motion Detection:** Implement motion detection algorithms to identify significant changes in the video stream.
**Alert Mechanism:** Trigger alerts when motion is detected.
**User Interface:** Develop an intuitive web interface for monitoring and controlling the system.

**Prerequisites**

Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Understanding of the HTML5 Canvas API
Basic understanding of image processing and computer vision concepts
